# SnowShoveling
An app to help people find yard help from others nearby. Free and easy to use.

App coded and designed by Sheen.

This project has been in development for a number of years, and has gone through many different design iterations and branding,
as well as styling, and even more. It is still a work in progress in terms of the UI, although the backend has been done for a while now. 
As with all my code, feel free to poke around and copy whatever you want.

I am going through the 'modern' design iteration. I had previously thought to do a couple other things, but as I learned more programming,
got more familiar with the world, and became aquainted with design, I have learned better/more efficient ways of doing things. This app has accompanied me through much of my iOS app 
development experience. I self-taught iOS by making this app, and it's been a journey. It will never be "done" as I will continue to improve upon it and update it, even past college applications. 
If you haven't realized, it's a project near and dear to my heart, but it's not nearly my best. That concludes my ted talk thank you for coming.

# Info to replicate project
The source code contains everything but GoogleService-Info.plist, which can be downloaded from the Firebase setup page and drag and dropped into the project.
You will also need to do `pod install` to install the pods. Make sure that you have pods installed on your device and you open the xcworkspace (whiter icon one) file.
