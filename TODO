This is a file of everything that needs to be done.

Frontend:

1. Map -- backend and frontend
2. Ratings -- need a non-editable rating class, backend --> Decided to make non-interactable rating

3. user Database!!
 -- use PostgreSQL later, once my own backend is needed.
Use Firebase for now and hopefully for a long time.

5. add user's contact info to the expanded job view

6. Fix the problem with resizing the Job Table Cells

Need to improve job class,
Need to create class to communicate with the database -> Firebase API

Backend:

1. Add contact info things to the `users` database table
2. am on step 3 of setup, need to install cocoapods, need admin pass
